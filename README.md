## pre-release binary build details

This repository contains various branches named `pre-release-v0.0.<seconds-since-epoch>`, which are automatically
generated by a [GitHub Actions script](https://github.com/earthly/earthly/blob/main/.github/workflows/staging-deploy.yml) in the 
[github.com/earthly/earthly](https://github.com/earthly/earthly) repository that is triggered on each run.

That script additionally creates a new branch in the [github.com/earthly/homebrew-earthly-staging](https://github.com/earthly/earthly) repository
which triggers a homebrew package to be built for MacOS users.
